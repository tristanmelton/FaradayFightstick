### FaradayFightstick
Utilize Hall Effect sensors in an open-source leverless.

Current plan: Use an ATMEGA microcontroller to read the analog out from the hall effect sensor located on the opposite side of the PCB from the switch. Then, the ATMEGA will act as the switch and output high or low to a Brooks board for each button press.

I ordered 5x AH1912-FA-7 hall effect sensors to test the output from a random key switch, probably the Gateron Jade. I have not ordered those yet because I am waiting for more money.
